export IP=10.10.46.54

nmap -sV -sC $IP

this is what we got from 1337 - with a connection reset

Welcome traveller, to the beginning of your journey
To begin, find the trollface
Legend says he's hiding in the first 100 ports
Try printing the banners from the ports

this says first 100 ports, so lets do that, later we can run a full scan? maybe

82 proftpd

so nfs is port 12345
on running nmap on this prt with nfs scripts

nmap -p 12345 -A --script nfs* $IP - this says nfs is on default port
nmap -p 111 -A --script nfs* $IP

111/tcp open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)
| nfs-showmount: 
|_  /home/nfs *

now
sudo mount $IP:/home/nfs/ /home/srini/notes/thmrooms/serverfromhell/mountdir

now we have a zip file backup.zip => which has password

locate zip2john

/usr/bin/zip2john backup.zip -o home/hades/.ssh/flag.txt => put this into random_hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt random_hash => zxcvbnm

hint.txt says 2500-4500
sudo nmap -sS -sV -p2500-4500 -A $IP

port is 3333
